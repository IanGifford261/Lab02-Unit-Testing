## Description

This is a C# console application that will ask prompt a user with the normal ATM menu that you would find at an ATM. There are multiple choices that you can pick such as "View Balance, Withdraw, Deposit, and exit."
A user can select each option while "withdrawing"/"depositing" currency and having it update.

#### Credit to assistance ####
Big shout out to Jamilah McWilliams, a 401 C# Alumni from Code Fellows and the Night TA for teaching me the ```Environment.Exit(0);``` command to give me a brute force solution when I was stuck deep, and helped me refactor my math so it would edit the total balance.
